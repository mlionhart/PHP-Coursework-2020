## Details

Using the PHP code examples provided in this module, **build a single page PHP app** that does the following:

- Allows a user to upload images, one at a time
- Displays the images on the page as a gallery
- Provides a link below each picture that allows you to delete the image from the gallery
- Style your page in a professional way. You should develop this lab to include in your portfolio of work.
- The use of Bootstrap is optional.
- You can use CSS grid and flexbox
- Push your code to GitHub
