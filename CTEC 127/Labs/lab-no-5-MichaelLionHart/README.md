This lab will have you clone this repository down to your computer. Once you have cloned the repo, you are to follow the instructions below.

## Repo Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- **README.md** - This file that you are currently reading. It's a file written in markup language known as Markdown.

- **lab5.php** - The PHP script that you will be working on
- **.gitignore** A file that is used to tell git to ignore certain types of files.

## Steps to Follow

1. By now you have already cloned this repository (repo), placed it somewhere in your XAMPP htdocs folder and opened it up in **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Open up **lab5.php** and review the HTML code in it.
3. In fact, open the file open in XAMPP to see what the page currently looks like.
4. Resize the browser to see the responsive web design that bootstrap provides.
5. Now that you are familiar with the page, it's time to review the tasks that you have been asked to perform.
6. You have been asked to provide a way via the URL of the page to only show the Aralia tree section, only the Arborvitae tree section, or only the Ash trees section.
7. They also want to show multiple tree sections as well such as only the Aralia and Ash, or all three groupings.
8. If there are no URL parameters present, all of the tree groupings should display.
9. You are too develop code that uses URL Query String parameters in combination with the PHP $_GET superglobal and program logic to achieve the desired functionality.   

## Staging Your Changes

1. Once you have completed your work and before you push your changes back to **GitHub**, you will need to first **stage** the file that you have changed which is **lab5.php**. If you modified any of the others files thatn make sure that these files also get staged.
2. In **Visual Studio Code** you should see a **1** next to the **Source Control** icon in the sidebar.
3. Click on the **Source Control** icon.
4. You will then see the letter **M** next to the **lab5.php** file. This means that the file has been modified.
5. Hover your mouse over **lab5.php** and you will see a **+** symbol appear.
6. Click on the **+** symbol. This will add your file to the **Git staging area**.
7. Now where you see the text box above you should see an area where you can type a message.
8. Enter the text **Lab No. 5 Submission**.
9. Click the **check mark**. This will **commit** your changes.

12. Enter **git push** and then press enter.
13. Your work will then get magically sent back to **GitHub**.
14. To check to see if your changes made it to **GitHub**, go to the URL of your repository and enter it into your browser. You will find this URL in the assignment. Click on it and it will take you to a page where you can find your **repo URL**.
15. You will then be brought to your repository. Click one on the lab5.php file to see if your code is there.
16. Please ask for help if you run into any problems or have any questions.
